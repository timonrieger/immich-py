Decision
	•	Exclude autogenerated CLI command code from unit-test coverage (# pragma: no cover at file or function level).
	•	Do not write unit tests for CLI commands.
	•	Rely on E2E tests for CLI behavior.
	•	Keep strict unit coverage on the client library.

Why
	•	CLI commands are autogenerated from OpenAPI and contain no business logic.
	•	Unit tests would only verify wiring/mocks, not behavior.
	•	Spec changes regenerate commands; unit tests would break without adding safety.
	•	E2E tests already catch real breakage (args → client → output).
	•	Coverage should reflect human-written logic, not generated glue.

Guardrail
	•	If any CLI command gains real logic, remove the pragma and add tests.
